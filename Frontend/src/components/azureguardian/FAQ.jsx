    q: "How often should Azure penetration tests be conducted?",
    a: "Regularly, at least annually or after significant changes to your Azure environment (e.g., new applications, major infrastructure updates). Compliance requirements might also dictate frequency. Continuous monitoring and periodic testing are best practices.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-1",
    q: "What are the risks of not conducting Azure penetration testing?",
    a: "Increased vulnerability to cyberattacks, leading to potential data breaches, financial losses, operational disruptions, reputational damage, and non-compliance with industry regulations and legal obligations.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-2",
    q: "How do you ensure compliance with Azure penetration testing policies?",
    a: "We strictly adhere to Microsoft's rules of engagement for penetration testing Azure. This includes obtaining necessary client permissions, defining clear scopes, and conducting tests in a non-disruptive manner to ensure full compliance.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-3",
    q: "How can Azure penetration testing enhance cloud security?",
    a: "It proactively identifies vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in your Azure setup. By simulating real-world attacks, it provides actionable insights and recommendations to strengthen your security posture, reduce attack surface, and improve incident response capabilities.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-4",
    q: "What is the typical duration of an Azure penetration test?",
    a: "The duration varies depending on the scope and complexity of the Azure environment being tested. A small, focused test might take a few days, while a comprehensive assessment of a large environment could take several weeks. We provide an estimated timeline after the initial scoping phase.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-5",
    q: "Do you provide a report after the Azure penetration test?",
    a: "Yes, a detailed report is a key deliverable. It includes an executive summary, a technical breakdown of vulnerabilities found (with severity ratings), proof-of-concept exploits where applicable, and actionable recommendations for remediation to improve your Azure security posture.",
