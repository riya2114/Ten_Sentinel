        <p className="text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          A cybersecurity audit is a vital tool for recognizing business-related
          risks and ensuring effective risk management. It acts as a benchmark
          to evaluate whether your security strategies and risk assessments are
          aligned with best practices.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          These audits should be tailored to your organization's specific risk
          profile and extend beyond internal systemsâ€”encompassing both logical
          and physical boundaries, including third-party vendors and partners.
